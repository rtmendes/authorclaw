**The Autonomous AI Writing Agent — An OpenClaw Fork Built for Authors**

AuthorClaw is a security-hardened AI agent purpose-built for fiction and nonfiction authors. Yes, it can write entire books — but that's just the beginning.

**AuthorClaw automates the boring stuff so you can focus on the creative stuff.** It handles book research, marketing competition analysis, file management, beta reading, copy editing, revision assistance, book bible building, story consistency checking, query letter drafting, literary agent research, ad copy generation, email list strategy, and more — all autonomously.

Tell it what you want. It figures out the steps, picks the right skills and tools, and executes.

> **"It's not just a writing tool. It's a writing partner, research assistant, editor, and marketing team rolled into one."**

---

## What Can It Do?

- **Write** — Draft scenes, chapters, and full manuscripts in your voice
- **Research** — Deep dives into genres, markets, historical periods, craft techniques
- **Revise** — Structural editing, pacing analysis, style consistency checks
- **Plan** — Outlines, beat sheets, series bibles, character arcs, world-building
- **Beta Read** — First-reader feedback with specific, actionable notes
- **Market** — Blurbs, ad copy, email sequences, social media content
- **Analyze** — Voice profiling (47 markers), pacing heatmaps, tension mapping
- **Format** — Export manuscripts to agent-ready DOCX, KDP PDF, EPUB, Markdown
- **Manage** — Track projects, word counts, goals, deadlines
- **Ingest Tools** — Read source code of any tool and create a new skill from it

---

## How It Works

1. **You say what you want** — via Telegram, dashboard, or API
2. **AuthorClaw plans the steps** — AI dynamically decomposes your task into executable steps
3. **Skills are auto-selected** — 25+ writing skills get injected into each step's context
4. **Work happens autonomously** — each step runs through the AI, output saved to files
5. **Everything is logged** — universal activity feed tracks all agent actions in real-time

## AI Providers

AuthorClaw supports 5 AI providers with tiered routing:

| Provider | Tier | Cost | Best For | Setup |
|----------|------|------|----------|-------|
| Ollama | FREE | $0 | Local, private | Install Ollama, runs at localhost:11434 |
| Google Gemini | FREE | $0 | General writing, planning | Dashboard → Settings → paste Gemini key |
| DeepSeek | CHEAP | ~$0.14/M tokens | Creative writing | Dashboard → Settings → paste DeepSeek key |
| Anthropic Claude | PAID | ~$3/M tokens | Complex reasoning, editing | Dashboard → Settings → paste Anthropic key |
| OpenAI GPT-4o | PAID | ~$2.5/M tokens | Alternative premium | Dashboard → Settings → paste OpenAI key |

Task routing is automatic — planning and research use free models, creative writing uses mid-tier, final editing uses premium (when available).

## Telegram Command Center

Connect a Telegram bot to control AuthorClaw from your phone:

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/goal [task]` | Tell AuthorClaw what to do — it plans steps and executes autonomously |
| `/write [idea]` | Shortcut for writing goals — plans a book from your idea |
| `/goals` | List all goals with status |
| `/status` | Quick status check |
| `/research [topic]` | Research a topic, save results to file |
| `/files [folder]` | List files in your workspace |
| `/read [file]` | Preview a file's contents |
| `/stop` | Pause the active goal |
| `continue` | Resume a paused goal |

### Example Session

```
You:      /goal write a full novel about rogue AI in aviation
AuthorClaw: Planning "write a full novel about rogue AI in aviation"...
AuthorClaw: Planned 15 steps. Running autonomously...
AuthorClaw: ✅ 1/15: Develop premise (~800 words)
            ⏭ Next: Create character profiles...
AuthorClaw: ✅ 2/15: Create character profiles (~2,400 words)
            ⏭ Next: Build world and settings...
...
AuthorClaw: 🎉 All 15 steps complete!
            📁 Files saved to workspace/projects/
```

---

## Dashboard

Open `http://localhost:3847` to access the web dashboard:

- **Settings** — API keys, AI providers, Ollama config, budgets, Telegram
- **Agent** — Give tasks, monitor goals, view skills
- **Activity Log** — Real-time feed of everything the agent does

---

## Dynamic Task Planning

When you give AuthorClaw a task, it doesn't use hardcoded templates. Instead:

1. The AI receives a catalog of all available skills (with descriptions and triggers)
2. The AI receives the list of Author OS tools
3. The AI dynamically plans the right number of steps, picks the right skills for each
4. Each step is executed with that skill's full content injected into the AI's context
5. Results from earlier steps are chained into later steps for continuity

If AI planning fails, the system falls back to template-based planning (8 goal types with pre-built step sequences).

---

## Skills

Skills are markdown files that teach the AI how to handle specific writing tasks:

**Author Skills (16):** premise, outline, write, revise, book-bible, series-bible, dialogue, style-clone, research, nonfiction-research, format, beta-reader, query-letter, manuscript-hub, market-research, promote

**Marketing Skills (4):** blurb-writer, ad-copy, social-media, email-list

**Core Skills:** full-pipeline (complete novel orchestration), plus system skills

**Tool Ingestion:** AuthorClaw can read source code of any tool and generate a new skill from it. Just say "create a skill from this code" or use `POST /api/tools/ingest`.

Skills are automatically matched by keyword triggers and injected into the AI's context.

### Premium Skills Bundle

The **AuthorClaw Premium Skills Bundle** adds 10 advanced capabilities — available on our [Ko-Fi store](https://ko-fi.com/writingsecrets) *(link coming soon)*:

## Setup Wizard

For a guided setup experience, run the interactive wizard:

```bash
bash scripts/setup-wizard.sh
```

It walks you through everything: OS detection, Node.js installation, Ollama setup, API key configuration, vault passphrase creation, and personalization (genre, word goals). It even generates a troubleshooting prompt you can paste into any AI chatbot if you get stuck.
